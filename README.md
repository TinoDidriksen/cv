Remember how you could hold down the Reset combination on an Amiga 500 to free up slightly more RAM in order to play the largest maps in [The Settlers](http://www.mobygames.com/game/serf-city-life-is-feudal)? And how overpowered Paladins were in [Master of Magic](http://www.mobygames.com/game/master-of-magic)? Good times, good times...

While I was hex-editing everything I could get my hands on trial&#39;n&#39;error style, including the raw block device itself, I wasn&#39;t terribly interested in [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) in those early days. That came along as my English vastly improved, because as every NLP person knows, English is a seductively easy language to write NLP algorithms for - shame they fall apart as soon as any morphologically complex language enters the picture.

These days, I primarily develop tools for use in various parts of computational linguistics, from live language analysis, through corpus query, to rule-based machine translation.

##Experience

**Software Developer**, GrammarSoft ApS, *March 2007 – Current*

c++, perl, php, javascript, mysql, postgresql

All the public-facing parts of the site, tools, and remote APIs. All the interaction between the front-end, the middle storage layer, and the linguistic back-ends. Performance optimization of said back-ends, including load-balancing and caching. Formatting-aware manipulation of rich text formats, such as DOCX, ODT, MediaWiki, in order to preserve the metadata through the machine translation engines.

---

**Software Developer**, Visual Interactive Syntax Learning, *April 2004 – Current*

c++, perl, php, javascript, java, mysql, postgresql

Full Stack DevOp. Everything from physically putting servers in racks, through LAMP/LAPP configuration and management, to software development and deployment. Website is in PHP and Perl, communicating with computational linguistics tools in C, C++, Perl, and PHP. Maintenance of Java applets, corpus query tools, live language analysis software, and machine translation tools. I basically have a finger in on every part of VISL.

---

**Software Developer**, LearnGreenlandic, *2010 – Current*

c++, qt, php, ffmpeg, mysql, postgresql

Wrote all the code for the program itself in C++ and Qt 5, including the copy-protection system. Mastered the ISOs/DVDs and made them auto-startable and usable cross-platform (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux), plus made MSI versions. Made the website using WordPress as framework, key verification via HTTP callbacks, and ordering system via PayPal&#39;s API. Manages all the tech parts, including tech support for when Windows and OS X updates break everything.

---

**Software Developer**, SwordsOnline.com, *August 2004 – December 2005*

php, javascript, mysql

Vastly improved security by properly using server-side storage. Improved performance by an order of magnitude by natural optimizations such as reducing the number of executed SQL queries from one per product listing, to fetch all products in a single query. Implemented new features, such as &quot;Customer Also Bought&quot; and &quot;Flash Sales&quot;. Also made a time management site to keep track of how long developers worked.

---

**Software Developer**, Ordret Consortium, *August 2004 – November 2005*

c++, perl, php, qt

Integrated a multi-process pipe of Perl and C++ language and grammar analysis tools with a MS Office proofing tool front-end for the [OrdRet project](http://ordret.com/). Greatly optimized loading times and memory usage of the linguistic data by using [on-disk databases](http://search.cpan.org/search?query=DB_File) instead of flat text files. Also wrote a performance, regression, and quality test suite.

##Education

**Computer Science**, Syddansk Universitet, *2011*

python, java, opengl, calculus, computer-science

[3D Tetris in Java+OpenGL (1st year project)](http://tetris.pjj.cc/) - the excuse for making it was to investigate the math behind 3D graphics.

---

**Computer Science**, Syddansk Universitet, *2002 – 2005*

c, java, linux-kernel, filesystems, computer-science, computer-architecture, calculus

These were the bad old days where the Java coding exam was done on paper and the mandatory first year included biology, physics, and chemistry. While I don&#39;t dislike those (all science is good science), I really wanted to focus on CompSci and was simply not allowed to do so, and thus dropped out. It did however introduce me to the [VISL project](http://visl.sdu.dk/) and academia in general, where I&#39;ve worked with computational linguistics ever since.
