Good times, good times...\n\nWhile I was hex-editing everything I could get my hands on trial\'n\'error style, including the raw block device itself, I wasn\'t terribly interested in [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) in those early days. That came along as my English vastly improved, because as every NLP person knows, English is a seductively easy language to write NLP algorithms for - shame they fall apart as soon as any morphologically complex language enters the picture.\n\nThese days, I primarily develop tools for use in various parts of computational linguistics, from live language analysis, through corpus query, to rule-based machine translation.',
